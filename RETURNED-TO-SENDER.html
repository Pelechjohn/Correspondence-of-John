ORGINAL MESSAGE</p1>
<br>
<p> 
<i>Dearest Johann,
Oh how long the days, how harsh the nights, how sad the moments of my life have been! Young Gupfield and you, my closest friends, have abandoned me. My family, my college, everything I had is gone, and I am forlorn. And where others would turn to friends, I am turned out by those to whom I should be able to turn towards. I pray that one day, the two of you shall come back to Sir Topaz (me, Caleb)’s arms. But for now, I realize that we are asunder. My mother told me that I am nothing to her, that I have been reduced to less than dust (for even dust is too good for me!—due to it’s biblical significance, as it were, dearest Johann). I write this from the public library, Johann, I need help. Keep me in your prayers, keep Caleb J. Siccamore in your prayers, though I now must abandon that name, for I have forsook it. I shall now truly become Sir William Topaz McGonagall.
You shall hear more from me as my life on these streets unfold, and I hope to hear from you as well.
Yours Truly and to the Utmost, Sir William Topaz McGonagall—formerly known as Caleb J. Siccamore, esq. </i>
