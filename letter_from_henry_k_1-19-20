Dear Pelech,

I find your treatment of our mutual friend, Sir William Topaz McGonagall deeply disturbing. Instead of providing Christian fellowship and a place of lodging for our distressed friend, you have allowed him to linger in the streets. Utterly shameful. While his heretical teetotal beliefs are genuinely disturbing, you must not leave a friend in the cold. 

Best regards,

Koselitz
