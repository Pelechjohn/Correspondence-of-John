<p> guppy i write you a short letter, i know you are busy, so what has happened then for me to excite a letter out from me? 
i want to share with you my good fortune. i have been spending many late nights in new york city chatting in the downtown bars something you have advised me against an advisement that is ultimately right but not even the best advice can insulate it's self from a streak of luck for a sailor who travels in rough waters  during the wrong time of year. 
i hear you gnashing guppy i hear your resent i hear that mind revolving the pragmatisms "get to the point get to the point you said it would be short let me have the rest of last night's soup and piece of dried bread before i go to my drudgery of a job ohhhh out with it john!share your good fortune while i do a really mans job go on money-ed boy! oh my tea-water is boiling and the humidity rises in the hair and ruins my hair the ends curl up, ohh how much i want to think in spanish" guppy i hear this im tuned in i will tell as quick as i can but your desire gums up my own mind and the flow of this letter chokes to a trickle under the oppression of your massive speeding conscience quell yourself, okay? So anyway i have spent my nights in so-ho the grenwhich village and hells kitchen the exciting neighborhoods of new york walking from bar to bar speaking about music poetry politics and women. Guppy i have soaked up the night life i have tales of romance and drug, but again im here to  renovate segment of that path and that is the opertunity i have  sequestered from the dinge of the new york bar bricks and that is my first writing contract. Through a tangle of connections which i will back trace i have been asked to write "a very short introduction of nick land" </p>
