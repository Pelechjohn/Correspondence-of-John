<p>
colin all the problems of nyc are the problems with-in everyone today city's are no special places especially today, they are just what happens when people are forced closer together and every scent of mans body can be wiffed. You know nyc was much worse than it was now, most people don't know this if they have no family connection with the place but from the mid 60's till the mid 90's new york city was a dangerous and hostile place like much of the other cities in the north east during this time. Colin I hope to meet you one day, try to disconnect from the meme's and the trendy thought of expired chan-culture.
