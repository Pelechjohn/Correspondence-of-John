Why did God create me John? Does he have a plan for me? A triumphant destiny? Or was he just bored trying not to masterbait like me? In any case i am here. As i bask in the morning sun of my 1 bedroom apartment on the shores of lake Michigan i think to me myself “isn’t it all so beautiful....isn’t it all so fucking ugly”. The sunlight off the newly formed ice creates a magnificent glow of radiant glory for my eyes to behold. But as soon as the shore becomes concrete im fucking utterly devastated. Who the fuck put this whole goddamn city here!? Did you do this god!? Did you put me here!? Oh shit i shouldn't of said that, now my pineal glad is acting up. I went to church on Sunday i’m covered. As far as i can tell i can be apart of the beautiful or the ugly, god will let me decide that much. What will you be apart of JOHN? HUH?! WTF JOHN?! JOHN
