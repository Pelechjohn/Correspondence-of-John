I sit here shocked by my own self guppy miserable hopefully for only a little, I have defamed you, by means of a great problem deep with-in my psyche keep those eyes on this-here guppy you have told me to move on and this sentence now is an extension of my failure to "let’s leave things there, and move on." but can I not tell you the short tale of my false simulations? Guppy not out of hate, more by fear a fear for the safety of my too kind heart did I write those incorrect passages about you. See Guppy my soul I too often lose the key to and so it is almost always slightly open ready to be sacked by anyone who can spell the words "John Pelech is a fool" or any synonym of that and what does a weak minded fool-heart do naturally he tries to harden himself against the world and obviously he fails and the rocks he eats break the dentistry to the marrow and agony comes, spasms de-linking the synchs of his ba and his bum in shock lost in his own skin he has a de-circulatory shiver dieing a little being drawn into the world of his mind by the torrent of retreating blood numbing the limbs icing the nose. In nerve, in self, I was afraid to fail, worried that this letter might fling out the window by a strange wind and by the devil I would become the letter and instead of my words be delivered to you i'm delivered to the ground or worse my words before you have no spark of attraction, and you I worried would cough mid-first sentence and I’d get thrown down on your cold tiled floor and that is why I had such negative declimations against you, false and evil expectations because I looked to sing notes that beat with the dissonance of the papers face that only talk to your apartment floor, so forgive me forgive me, yes this is all pathological, yes I am like the cuck, yes!

Now guppy you speak of legacy and the literary mask these things I can't think of I will be eviscerated by them and how are they compatible with an infinite calm how can we be infinitely calm if we are pierced with the views and possible interpretations of every word we say we will be like chalk in water. We have gone so far already we have followed the snake-ing letters and words hurdled the periods and collided with the whitespace of our minds and tweeted to the great outer lengths, and we find ourselves in the infinite scrolling page and all the words can be put in all the orders here and it is chilling to have this new task we are fledglings it is in a world now de-nested and unroofed world we are in but we know words are the same said indoors as they are outdoors, they still can be a pleasure and we know the depth of our companionship it's great strength let the world collect around us envious,become blind by our locked gaze we can talk through condensed breath in this very large space and the legacy will follow wherever our frosted air may occupy. You know guppy, there is a man in despair he is touching himself especially his face trying to regain some contact with his piece of mind that has dissolved away like styrofoam in gasoline and then he catches his own self in a mirror and he thinks that this face in awful despair could communicate something positive and pull him out of it all the energy of this moment and the emotional collisions maybe sometimes if his face is a great piece of granite or she is a pearl, but for everyone else ugly to basic we can rarely find land in our appearance so forget ourselves look onto each other and get back to our words all we have.
