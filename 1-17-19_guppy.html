<h1> Letter to Guppy - 1/20/20 </h1>
<a href="https://pelechjohn.github.io/Correspondence-of-John"/>index </a>
<p> guppy good fortune has shaken from me a letter so will you respond before the befallen fruit rots. as you know i have been spending many late nights in new york city, downtown socializing in the clubs and bars something you have advised me against, but not even the best and most correct advice can insulate itself from good luck. i hear you gnashing gup i hear resent i hear that mind revolving and the snarky jabs swim slapping one hundred laps "get to the point get to the point you said it would be short let me have the rest of last night's soup and a piece of dried bread before i go to my drudgery of a job ohhhh out with it john! share your good fortune a real man who has an honest job doesn't even have an hour before he must find himself at his workplace and he especially doesn't want you to fill that time with your dandy tales, but go on go on money-ed boy! oh my tea-water is boiling and the humidity rises in the kitchen and it ruins my hair the ends curl up, ohh how much i want to think in spanish" guppy i hear this im tuned in i will tell as quick as i can but your desire for expediency gums up my mind with bad humors and chokes down the flowing of this pencil from a torrent to a limp pensive trickle. I will embark from this then like how I walk from bar to bar speaking about music poetry politics and women. In a big city like new york you meet so many people, I wonâ€™t poison this letter with too many repetitive lists, but those employed in positions only for those with elite educations clog up the drink orders and a graduate student is likely is the man behind the bar tying up your drink. so  guppy i have soaked up the night life i have tales of romance and drug, but again im here to renovate only one segment of that path for the sake of time and that parcel is a piece of fertile opportunity that i have sequestered from the dinge of the new york brick and that is my first writing contract. Through a tangle of connections which i will back trace if you wish i have been asked to write "a very short introduction of nick land" </p>
