<p> guppy good fortune has shaken from me a letter so will you respond before the befallen fruit rots. as you know i have been spending many late nights in new york city, downtown socializing in the clubs and bars something you have advised me against, but not even the best and most correct advice can insulate it's self from good luck. i hear you gnashing guppy i hear your resent i hear that mind revolving and the snarky jabs that swim one hundred laps "get to the point get to the point you said it would be short let me have the rest of last night's soup and piece of dried bread before i go to my drudgery of a job ohhhh out with it john!share your good fortune a real man who does an honest job doesn't even have an hour before he must find himself at his work place and he especially doesn't want you to fill it with your dandy tales go on go on money-ed boy! oh my tea-water is boiling and the humidity rises in the air and ruins my hair the ends curl up, ohh how much i want to think in spanish" guppy i hear this im tuned in i will tell as quick as i can but your desire for yeilds the reverse that call for expediance gums up my own mind with bad humors and the flow of this letter choke down to a trickle under, quell yourself okay? So anyway i have spent my nights in so-ho the grenwhich village and hells kitchen the exciting neighborhoods of new york walking from bar to bar speaking about music poetry politics and women. Guppy i have soaked up the night life i have tales of romance and drug, but again im here to  renovate segment of that path and that is the opertunity i have  sequestered from the dinge of the new york bar bricks and that is my first writing contract. Through a tangle of connections which i will back trace i have been asked to write "a very short introduction of nick land" </p>
