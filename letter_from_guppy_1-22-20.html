Dear John, </p1>
<br>
<p> 
I write to you from the terrace of a university café in the freezing cold with a clenched fist. I am neither employed nor enrolled at this university. I am not employed or enrolled anywhere. But sometimes I like to come here, and march around, and ask where this faculty and that faculty is, and spend a while in the library and pretend that I belong here. I have just tried (and failed) to write a poem that follows the style, but makes to pretense to match the quality of, the poem *Aubade</i> by Phillip Larkin. I'll present the first four lines to you, and by extension to our audience, as an act of openness and humiliation:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Daylight carves my shadow from the wall</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lifting my head, it corresponds, we stare.</i>
</p>
<p>

<i>With every passing minute it will fall</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And in an hour or two he won't be there.</i>"
</p>
<p>
I am beginning to realise, John, that I am drawn and pushed around by the same dirty familial desires as everyone else. I have begun a dream journal in order to track my conscious desires. Several nights ago I dreamed that I was a prolific slut. I murdered my lovers, stuffed their bodies into black and blue bin bags, and left them out with the recycling. I was terrified of being discovered, because even in my dreams the council only takes the bins out once a fortnight. The following night I made hamburgers with an *abuela*.
</p>
I, too, am afraid if being found a fool, John. Sometimes, early in the morning when the sunlight teases my persian blinds, a sinister voice woven from expiring dreams and alcohol accuses me of being a communist, a homosexual and a parvenu. But I have decided to leave affectation to the side and put my faith, my whole faith, in my unconsciousness, in intuition, writing as I like and hoping that some unconscious beauty will fall and nestle. There really is no technique in anything, John
 <p>
 
Yours affectionately, 
</p>

 <p>
 
William Guppy
