It pains me to say this but these are not real letters. A quick perusing of the currently published correspondence makes this abundantly clear. The subtle mysteries of the unopened letter, the anticipation of a response, all of this is made immediate and immediately ugly by your posting them online. 

In a just world, you would be found slumped over your desk, dead either by your own hand or by a disappointingly early stroke, with reams of unopened correspondence from the great and good of the twitterati littered about you. These would be published in a piecemeal fashion  over years, even decades, feeding into conspiracies and rumours, destroying families, being resold and fraudulently altered by unscrupulous collectors. None of this can be as it is now. 

I am, and remain, a rabbit in the headlamps of your harsh gaze
