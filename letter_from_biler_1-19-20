<h1> Letter from Biler 1-19-20 </h1>

Hey man. This is Biler from the internet twitter. You know ghosts? I don't really know them. Do you think you have to be a ghost to "know" a ghost? I remember reading some philosopher whose name escapes me but he said ghosts were an early sort of god. Spirits were the proto-god, as it were. I'm not certain. It is an evolutionary idea, I guess. Sometimes I think ghosts are real but other times I think it is a wish materialized by the imagination to make us feel we "know" something more than others. We see an existence from a whole other world. I am fucking afraid of the ghost even moreso than of girls. When I lay in bed at night I have a feeling, What if a hideous face of an apparition materializes, a face so grotesque that I lose my sanity? but never do I fear a burglar or some shitty bastard beating me with a tire iron although that is entirely more likely. Anyway, I hope you are doing fucking fantastic and this weekend a vampiric vapor sinks its teeth into your ass giving you a new zest for life.

Adieu. Adieu.
