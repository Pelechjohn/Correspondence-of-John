I know you are not actually TD’s girlfriend I know her quite well. This is clearly from some very strange homosexual and I have no interest in dealing with your corupt psychology. If you want to stalk and predate after people go to your local gay bar keep your shattered mind in the city gutters and freaky bathroom spots. This is a forum for heightened conversation not faux-letters not from gay freaks

Leave me alone
