<h1> Letter from Jacob Hupman (spookcity) - 1-18-20 </h1>

<br>
<p>biting my cock off, John. I want to live laugh love it, John. Isn’t that a funny little joke, John? If you were here next to me now I would pour my heart piously for you, meander over, under, two knocking eyes. Curl my arms into my breast, beat my voice, for your pleasure of course, and describe it. How I am tonight. Were you here now with me in the little car, I would hardly hold a kiss, frustratedly check longing, fluttering your ginger lap with my cheek. And goring myself. I’m a great deal of pain tonight, dear John, I’m only a great deal of pain today John. A friend, John. A friend, my Jonathan. You could come tonight and see me, my favorite John.
