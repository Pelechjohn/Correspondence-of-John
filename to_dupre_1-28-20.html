Dupre,

<p> 
let me try to condense your last letter to a short summary, these letters are not material and they lack that private nature cancelled by the immediate public posting, aswell as the joyful of anticipation between of the letter recipient and sendee. Thomas I have never opened a written letter in my life, or participated in the antiquated process of sending something hand written in the mail, so all the material effects disappearing are no loss to me. The form always gives an underlying subject, it's the receiver and that is why I am interested in the literary performance.

Let me devert a little Thomas, it is said that the streets of the a city and it's squares were like the Internet is now, one could wonder out and find any kind of conversation or media they were looking for. The participants in the streets of the pre-internet city would not qualify as lonely, on the other had the very online whom are illuminated with many messages and e-friendships, are truly without much debate alone and lonely. I think they are like their predecessors and the the actors of street-life were as lonely as most of our peers, but the superficial quality of physical closeness made it impossible to say something like that. True friends in the conversation will meet face to face within the firelight that burns from their laughter, anecdotes and memories, but it is always accidental. I tell you that is why the letters are more important than the housing and the route they travel. This is so intimate, and more focused than any prayer or conversation.
