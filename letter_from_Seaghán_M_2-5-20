<p> 
John one hopes this letter finds you well and will not overbear in its outpouring of fraternal love. I compose on the metro, but anywhere my mind is a rank abattoir astunk with the slops of shame and battered repugnant creatures of memory. But slung from this muck I find some cleaner trophies of our correspondence. I am some detestable thing this morning, a ghoul, the adolescent girls are staring at me and not in a good way John, I look and smell like a waster, I’m barely able to type, but they don’t know what fantastic gouts of love work through me at every moment, and all the things that I am thinking about, Elizabeth in her lonely plateau estate and Amanda with her beautiful spic family in the ghetto and my brother near dead taking cold baths in drowning flies, every minute of my life is overflowing with senseless devotion and hatred and I can’t help but proselytse and speak sincerely to you because you are my friend John, and it’s a sight to marvel at, the delicate insistence of your kindness, not just to me, but to so many on this silly bird site, from every day’s patrol and accountance, you are there for those like myself, I have no friends, I repel and destroy the people around me, but you aren’t pervious to my terrors, John I’m saying that you are a kind man sincerely, genuinely, we are all elevated by your presence.
