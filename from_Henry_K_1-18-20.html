Dear Pelech,

I have arrived home after drinking roughly half a fifth of scotch and bourbon. I don't know what great insights you expect from me in this condition, but I will give it a go. (Taking a smoke break to ponder what might seem clever). Anyway, I am sorry your marriage with Guppy has gone sour, these things take work. Chin up, there are more fish in the sea. I don't know why W. Topaz McGonagall II is a Christ figure, like Prince Myshkin. Perhaps you seething I don't? 

Best regards,

Koselitz </p>
