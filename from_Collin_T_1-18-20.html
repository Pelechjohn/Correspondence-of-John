hello mr federal agent, it is ur boy @sixthreeirl. If this a honeypot, it is very much working. I hope this letter finds you well, are you still in NYC? The city is demonic, it’s the financial brain of the great satan. A hellhole of smokestacks, journos, and “human capital” that shouldnt exist. I would never patronize such a horrible establishment and you should move to the west coast. HMU when you are west and we can go to beach, read land in the Pomona Library, meet Moldbug, meet rw bb bros, and get absolutely smashed. Crusty nyc twitter is rich and lives like poors in boxes, Cali twitter is poor and lives like kings. Will you accept, or will you shirk from your destiny?
