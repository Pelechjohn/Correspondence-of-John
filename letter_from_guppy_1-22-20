Dear John,

I write to you from the terrace of a university caf√© in the freezing cold with a clenched fist. I am neither employed nor enrolled at this university. I am not employed or enrolled anywhere. But sometimes I like to come here, and march around, and ask where this faculty and that faculty is, and spend a while in the library and pretend that I belong here. I have just tried (and failed) to write a poem that follows the style, but makes to pretense to match the quality of, the poem *Aubade* by Phillip Larkin. I'll present the first four lines to you, and by extension to our audience, as an act of openness and humiliation:

*Daylight carves my shadow from the wall

Lifting my head, it corresponds, we stare.

With every passing minute it will fall

And in an hour or two he won't be there.*

I am beginning to realise, John, that I am drawn and pushed around by the same dirty familial desires as everyone else. I have begun a dream journal in order to track my conscious desires. Several nights ago I dreamed that I was a prolific slut. I murdered my lovers, stuffed their bodies into black and blue bin bags, and left them out with the recycling. I was terrified of being discovered, because even in my dreams the council only takes the bins out once a fortnight. The following night I made hamburgers with an *abuela*.

I, too, am afraid if being found a fool, John. Sometimes, early in the morning when the sunlight teases my persian blinds, a sinister voice woven from expiring dreams and alcohol accuses me of being a communist, a homosexual and a parvenu. But I have decided to leave affectation to the side and put my faith, my whole faith, in my unconsciousness, in intuition, writing as I like and hoping that some unconscious beauty will fall and nestle. There really is no technique in anything, John

Yours affectionately, 

William Guppy
