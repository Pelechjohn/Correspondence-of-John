Guppy

How much I wish prose was like music. Guppy how much do I wish everything was music. Guppy the rhythms that I want to latch are dropped by the tongue when he doesn't wear his poetic accent.

 I wish I could be at a cafe too, I wish that I could feel that I belong not where I am. I am at home and this home will be sold in less than a year and I don't know where I will be. In the last day that I'm in this home will I feel strange? I want to feel nothing I want calm, but I have cried about it not like a man should. Will my parents look at me after they sign all these papers with a red face blown down by the wave of change they made, will they acknowledge that they have just made some horrible mistake. What are they expecting to happen when they move away from everyone who loves them and where they have made a home something that can not be rebuilt no matter how many times you place together some pieces of wood. What am I arguing for guppy? Guppy, I shouldn't be here my presence is un-natural here, and what am I looking to preserve all the bad memories that flavor the walls having left a scum on top of this rooms paint. What is meaning of crying why do I ask. Crying is involuntary like the tragedy that evokes it and I will leave it alone like a stranger struggling with tears.

Your poem Guppy can you laugh at me I thought about interpreting it, cut off my tongue what I should do is add.

soft noises echo, men outside and distant
turning light it twists a day down into night
he comes home big my shadow fills non-existence
And in an hour or few he will be alight

Guppy this letter is getting too fat and thirsty, I am tired let me rest

Again Again,

John Pelech
