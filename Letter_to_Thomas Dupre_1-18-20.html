<h1> Letter to Thomas Dupre - 1-18-20 </h1>

<p>
thomas I don't know how to feel about your letter, part of me is grateful that you have given a few of your muscular contractions to press on this boulderous project and it's my habit to be kind. On the other hand Dupre it is my tendency and nature to contrast my first nature, so i will speak critically few things are more disappointing than a half filled form something made flimsy that demands stone. Is the self-consciousness truly what bothers you or is it that you found yourself in the first sentence of a truly worthy and good letter and were too tired and cowardly to complete it?
