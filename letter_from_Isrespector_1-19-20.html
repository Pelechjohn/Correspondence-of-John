Dearest Tim Dillon, </p1>
<br>
<p> 
I have enjoyed your recent instagram post in which you dress like a blonde woman, that nobody watches.
</p>
<p>
I have read your exchanges with William J. Guppy and my disappointment is deep and vast, like your fathers shadow in your unconscious mind. From beneath my slouched hat I drop this tear into the sea of your direct messages. All of the pacific does not contain such wealth as this one wee drop that is this letter to you. William is one of the finest minds of our generation, and like Boehme, who hated Goethe, you rant and rave about “The Gup” constantly, even though he repeatedly gave you the “D” (Dickens). He gave all of us the “D”. Without him we would be “Dickless”.  
</p>

<p>
A paradox is a person or thing that combines contradictory features. You are such a thing. In private, you are a formal and a fair enough chap, but in public? You viciously slander W. Jefferson Guppy and I must ask: to what end? Where do you think this is going? Do you believe there is a J. Pelech without a William J. Guppy? No. You need each other, you complete each other, like the whale needs Ahab, like Ahab needs the whale. I am forced to stand and watch you two destroy each other, and am left despondent like Ahab's widow. But I will no longer be silent. Consider this letter a warning.
</p>
<p>
Yet I have high hopes for you. I hope this paradox becomes a resolution in itself, like the writings of Heraclitus. Ah, better to sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunk Christian. Straight up, leap thy apotheosis!
</p>
<p>
With kind regards but a splintered brow,
