<h1> Letter from Guppy - 1-18-20 </h1>

Dear John,
</p1>
<br>
<p2 style="margin: 10%;>
I regret that I will have to begin our correspondence with a reproach, but here we find ourselves. I will correct you on a number of points which came about in your letter to me. Despite the rather ugly portrait which you have painted of me in your letter as a gnashing, impatient and spiteful tart, you should know that approach our friendship with an infinite calm and patience which goes appreciated. Perhaps, John, the reason which I do not respond to you as often as you would like me to, is because I am disposed to read and re-read, to masticate and to savour, to slurp up and to meditate upon every one of the messages which you send before I find myself in a position to respond to them with all of the consideration that they deserve. That I might take such care, that I so seldom respond to your messages, John, you may have considered a compliment, and not an insult, as you have unfortunately chosen to.
Perhaps, perhaps, it may have been <i>así</i>. Do you remember, John, what Lacan said about the husband who, without proof, nevertheless suspected his wife of infidelity? I will remind you. He said that the wife <i>did</i> in fact cuckold him, and without leaving a trace of evidence which would arouse the suspicion of the husband. That is to say, that despite his wife’s infidelity, the husband’s jealousy continued to be a <i>pathological trait</i>. Let’s leave things there, and move on.
Now, John: I fear that these New Yorkish nights which you boast of, in which you explicitly mention drugs and romance, and vaguely allude to rubbing shoulders with members of high society, are in danger of making you ridiculous should you extrapolate upon them further. Let me explain: We should remain aware, John, that whatever we write now will reflect upon us in the years to come, and that no experience is ever as good as its written product. Now, the 20th century writer was conscious of which version of himself would climb out of the tomb and walk the Earth for eternity once was is gone, of which <i>author</i> would sprout, not only from his works, but from his private correspondences and from private anecdotes, and invade the public imagination after his death. And for this reason he wore a mask, not only above the pen, but in every aspect of his life, so that his <i>work</i> might find favourable light under his reputation through those who knew him.</p2>

<p3 style="margin: 10%;>
We find ourselves, John, in the curious position of forming our reputation through public correspondences and anecdotes which we publish in the act of writing them, as we continue to breathe. Another curiosity: Our reputation is the entirety of the thing; we have nothing which might be called a body of work, the periphery of which we can decorate with letters and anecdotes. On the contrary, the periphery is formed first, and the works to come will be read under the image which we have so carefully constructed. I mean to say that some sort of inversion is taking place. In short, in short: Be careful.</p3>

<i>John, John, I direct these messages to you, but I am locked into a private ritual; a meditation for which your name is the mantra.</i></p4>
<br>
<p5 style="margin: 10%;>
<i>Yours affectionately,</i>
<i>William Guppy</i></p5>
